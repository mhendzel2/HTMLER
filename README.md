   - Check browser console for API errors

2. **Build Errors**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check TypeScript errors in components

3. **News Not Loading**
   - Verify API key permissions include news endpoints
   - Check network connectivity
   - Look for CORS or rate limiting issues

### Support

## ðŸ¤– Local AI Agent (R&D-Agent + gpt-oss-20b)

The repository includes an optional Python setup for experimenting with a
local R&D-Agent instance backed by the open-source `gpt-oss-20b` model.

### Setup

1. Create and activate the Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f rd_agent/environment.yml
   conda activate rdagent
   ```

2. Start your local model (e.g., via Ollama or vLLM) and expose it through
   LiteLLM. Configure R&D-Agent with environment variables:

   ```bash
   export CHAT_MODEL=gpt-oss-20b
   export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000  # LiteLLM proxy
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy
   ```

3. Run the example trading assistant:

   ```bash
   python rd_agent/trading_agent.py
   ```

The script outputs a structured trade idea generated by the local model.

## ðŸ”’ Security

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data is logged or cached in browser
- All API requests use secure HTTPS connections
- Built-in rate limiting prevents API abuse
